## 🔒 Security Notes

### Implemented Security Measures
- ✅ **XSS Protection**: All user-controlled fields (names, notifications, timestamps) are HTML-escaped before rendering
- ✅ **HTML Injection Prevention**: Leaderboard agent names and metrics are escaped using `escapeHtml()` utility
- ✅ **Notification Sanitization**: Toast notifications use `textContent` (not `innerHTML`) to prevent script injection
- ✅ **Form Input Validation**: Client-side validation on all user inputs

### Production Readiness
- This is a demo app with plain-text passwords
- For production use, implement proper authentication (Firebase, OAuth)
- Keep your Google Apps Script URL confidential
- Use HTTPS only in production
- Regularly backup your Google Sheet
- Review and test all user input handling
